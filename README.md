# Wine-Quality-Classification
This project predicts red wine quality using chemical properties like acidity, pH, and alcohol. Data preprocessing included cleaning, PCA for reducing multicollinearity, and SMOTE for balancing classes. A Random Forest Classifier was trained to classify wines as Low, Medium, or High with strong accuracy.
